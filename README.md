# ck2utils

This repository will contain utilities and reference code for working with *Crusader Kings II*, a PC grand strategy game from Paradox Development Studios which models Feudal, Iqta, Tribal, and Nomadic rulers in the period 769-1453 AD (and much more through modding). A lot of the code should also prove very reusable for the related title *Europa Universalis IV*.

### Purpose

This collection of tools is general purpose. The author has other repositories for special-purpose work written for various CKII modding projects. It's my hope that somebody may find this code useful either directly or through adaptation to their project, although please note the default [GPLv2 software license](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zijistark/ck2utils/master/LICENSE) if considering redistribution of any derived work. Contact the author if you need a more permissive license for some reason.

### Environment

For now, the majority of these tools and code will be targeted for the [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.org/) or Linux runtime environments, although native Windows tools may eventually be included.  The primary language of implementation will be C++ along with Python and Perl.

### Questions

Feel free to contact the author for any questions regarding the code or the utilities and how to use them. Suggestions and, of course, contributions are also very welcome.
